# FileSysExplorer
A Node.js application that allows users to explore their file system, perform basic file operations, and retrieve information about their operating system.

List of possible operations:

1. File System Navigation: Users can navigate through directories and view files and subdirectories.

2. File Operations: Users can perform basic file operations such as creating, deleting, renaming, and editing files.

3. OS Information: Users can request information about their operating system, including platform, architecture, CPU details, total and free memory, and user information.

4. Events Handling: Implement event handling to track file system changes such as file creation, deletion, and modification.

5. Asynchronous File Operations: Utilize asynchronous file operations for better performance and responsiveness.

6. Stream-based File Reading/Writing: Provide options for stream-based file reading and writing for handling large files efficiently.

7. User Interface: Create a simple command-line interface (CLI) or a web-based interface to interact with the application.

8. Error Handling: Implement error handling to gracefully handle file system errors and other potential issues.

9. Promisify File Operations: Use the util.promisify utility to convert callback-based file operations into Promise-based operations for cleaner asynchronous code.

10. Documentation and Testing: Document the project thoroughly and write tests to ensure its functionality and reliability.
